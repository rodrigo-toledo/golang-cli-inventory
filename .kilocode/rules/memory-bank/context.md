# Active Context

## Current work focus

- Initialize the project's Memory Bank to capture the high-level project context and make future sessions resumable.
- Provide concise, developer-focused documentation that mirrors the project's existing `OVERVIEW.md` and `PROJECT_SPEC.md`.

## Recent changes (this session)

- Created the following memory-bank files:
  - `brief.md` — project summary and goals.
  - `product.md` — users, core flows, UX goals.
  - `architecture.md` — architecture, patterns, testing rules.
  - `tech.md` — tech stack, tooling, common commands.
  - `context.md` — (this file) current session focus, recent changes, and next steps.

## Next steps

1.  Review the newly created memory bank files for accuracy and completeness.
2.  Encourage maintainers to keep the memory bank up-to-date whenever major decisions are made (architecture changes, new workflows, or CI/migration changes).
