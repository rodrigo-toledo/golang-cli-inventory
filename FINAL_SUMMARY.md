## Final Summary

✅ Successfully implemented separation of unit and integration tests using Go build tags
✅ Created new Makefile targets for more efficient testing:
   - make unit-test (fast, no database required)
   - make integration-test (with database)
   - make test-all (both unit and integration)
✅ Updated documentation in README.md
✅ Unit tests are working correctly
⚠️ Integration tests have database schema consistency issues that would require additional work to resolve
