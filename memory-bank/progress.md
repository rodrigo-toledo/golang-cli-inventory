# Progress

Date: 2025-08-09

Summary of completed work
- Initialized the Memory Bank directory: `memory-bank/`.
- Created core Memory Bank files:
  - `projectbrief.md` — project summary and goals.
  - `productContext.md` — users, core flows, UX goals.
  - `systemPatterns.md` — architecture, design patterns, DB/sqlc rules, and testing practices.
  - `techContext.md` — technical stack, tooling, and developer commands.
  - `activeContext.md` — current session focus, recent changes, and next steps.
  - `progress.md` — (this file) current status and outstanding tasks.

What works now
- The Memory Bank contains the required core documents specified by the Memory Bank spec.
- Documents reflect the main contents of the project's OVERVIEW.md and PROJECT_SPEC.md and provide actionable developer guidance (setup, commands, testing, and workflow).
- Files are committed locally (saved to the repository workspace). Maintain the files under version control as needed.

Open / pending tasks
1. Add integration notes
   - Detailed instructions for running integration tests locally (dockertest vs docker-compose).
   - Any environment variables or test DB conventions.

2. Add feature-specific docs (optional)
   - e.g., Report generation details, export formats, or CLI flag conventions.

3. Keep memory bank up-to-date
   - Update `activeContext.md` after major changes (schema migrations, CI updates, new features).
   - Record progress in `progress.md` with short dated entries when milestones are reached.

4. (Recommended) Add a README inside `memory-bank/`
   - Brief explanation of the Memory Bank purpose and a short checklist for maintainers when updating.

How to use
- New sessions / contributors should read `projectbrief.md` first, then `productContext.md` and `techContext.md`.
- Before starting new work, review `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` for the latest state and next steps.
- When making changes to the project that affect architecture, workflows, or tests, update the relevant memory-bank files and add a short entry in `progress.md`.

Status
- Memory Bank initialization: COMPLETE
- Remaining (optional) tasks left to the maintainers: as listed above.
