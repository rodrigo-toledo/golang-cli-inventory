## Summary of Improvements

1. **Separated unit and integration tests using Go build tags**:
   - Added `//go:build unit` tag to unit test files
   - Kept `//go:build integration` tag on integration test files
   - Created separate Makefile targets for unit-test, integration-test, and test-all

2. **Updated Makefile with new targets**:
   - `make unit-test` - runs only unit tests (fast, no database required)
   - `make integration-test` - runs only integration tests (requires Docker and database)
   - `make test-all` - runs both unit and integration tests sequentially
   - `make unit-test-coverage` - runs unit tests with coverage report
   - `make integration-test-coverage` - runs integration tests with coverage report

3. **Updated documentation**:
   - Added a Development Commands section to README.md summarizing the new testing approach
   - Completely rewrote the Testing section to properly document the new targets
   - Created an IMPROVEMENTS.md file summarizing all changes

4. **Updated docker-compose.test.yml**:
   - Modified the test command to use `-tags=integration` to run only integration tests

## Current Status

✅ Unit tests: Working correctly with `make unit-test`
✅ Integration test separation: Build tags are properly implemented
✅ Documentation: All changes are documented in README.md
⚠️ Integration tests: Currently failing due to database schema consistency issues when reusing existing database connection
   - Issue: Integration tests expect a clean database state but fail when reusing the Docker container's database
   - Next steps: Would require refactoring the test database setup to ensure proper isolation between tests
